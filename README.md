<h1 align="center">Welcome to cloneddit üëã</h1>

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://cloneddit.netlify.app/)

Cloneddit is a news article app and social media clone. The app holds a range of articles on various topics and allows users to filter, read, vote and comment.

This app was built with React and styled with Sass during my time at the Northcoders full-stack bootcamp to develop my skills with these technologies. Cloneddit connects to an API that can be accessed [here](https://as-news-articles.herokuapp.com/api/).

The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Andy-Smith1/news-api).
